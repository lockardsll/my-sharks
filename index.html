                        <ul>
                            <li>They are capable of swimming at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour, and can make sudden, explosive movements when hunting prey.</li>
                            <li>Their sleek, torpedo-shaped bodies, dark grey dorsal surfaces, and white underbellies make them easily recognizable.</li>
                            <li>Great white sharks are often portrayed in popular culture as mysterious and dangerous creatures, which only adds to their "cool" factor.</li>
